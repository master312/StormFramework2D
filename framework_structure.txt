        -Texture manager should only do: "Load/Unload,Instance,UsageTrack,DrawMethod"
        -Object manager should do: "DrawAllOnScreen,SortObjects(by z), hold texture parameters map"
        -Rename texture parameters to like "GraphObjectProperties"
        -Create texture sections manager. GraphicsObject manager should not see diffirence
         -between texture and texture part.
