//TOOD: NOW! Organize texture by texture parametar object...
        On "Load()" create new texture if its not loaded.
        Then create new "txtParametar" object and return it's ID
        When user is accessing texture, he will be going through 
        "txtParametar" object, witch will contain pointer to texture object.
        Texture usage is calculated same way it is now.
//TODO: Create texture spliting system, if texture is bigger then hardware supports
//TODO: in logger, pass 'va_list ap' as reference
//TODO: Cleanup/rewrite cEventSDL2 class
//TODO: Draw manager... example {
    1. Create new structure that hold graphics
