1. >> //DONE-HIGH!!!!!!!!: New event system
    In cLayer create new event callbacks.
    OnKeyDown(),
    OnKeyUp(),
    OnMouseDown(),
    OnMouseUp(),
    OnMouseMotion(),
    OnWindowResize()
    And call them from 'cEventBase'
    !!Also Event callbacks are totally unneeded!!
>>TODO: Proveri: negde u main klasama se tick() direkno izlaze, 
        a negde moras da radis sGetManager().tick()
        Standardizuj jednu metodu
2. >> //TODO-HIGH: Better names for texture methods
        LoadTexture is not acurrate anymore. We now manipulate
        with texture objects, not raw textures!
3. >> //TODO: Fix animation! Broken because of new objects system

>>//TODO-MEDIUM: Rename 'callback' to 'interupt'
>>//TODO-MEDIUM: Move callback folder to core
>>//TODO-MEDIUM: Better callback creating method S_AddIntervalCB (2 complicated to create sCalback object every time)
>>//TODO-AFTER ^^: Test everything.. like a lot

//TODO-RESEARCH-MEDIUM: Mod color system
